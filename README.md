# testpack

The goal of testpack is to pass the final assignment of the course "Building R Packages" that
belongs to the COURSERA "Mastering Software Development in R" specialization.

The package contains a set of functions aimed at loading and visualizing data from the US
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is
a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered
in motor vehicle traffic crashes.
